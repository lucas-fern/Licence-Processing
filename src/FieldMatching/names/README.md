# Names
> A poor quality attempt to determine whether a line of text is more likely to 
> contain a name or is just a sequence of words.

This directory contains the data about words frequently used in english, and
the most popular names according to the US census.

If this document detection algorithm is actually deployed it would be _much_ 
more sensible to just search the text in a licence for names in the 
client's database.
